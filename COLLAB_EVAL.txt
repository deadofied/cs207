We sent our SDL extensions to Connor and Soren. 

We didn't integrate any other code. If we had more time we would've integrated some of Jody's SDL extensions (keyboard integration such as play/pause of force-based drawing algorithms) as we asked her for them and received them, but didn't have time to look into them.
